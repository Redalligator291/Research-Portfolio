## Workflow

### Work for the Week of Jan. 6th, 2025
1. Focus on the **EPPS** compound, starting with its interaction with trimer species.
2. Evaluate binding using the six conformers of the trimer.
3. Analyze the binding mechanism to understand potential drug interactions.

### General Workflow
1. **Read the reference paper** to understand the hypotheses for each drug target.
2. **Analyze the gathered information** to identify binding sites and mechanisms for each compound.
3. Utilize the SMILES codes provided to generate structures for simulations.
4. Investigate interactions between the compounds and AB42 species using docking and molecular dynamics tools.
