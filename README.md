|---|---|
| **Intended Major** | Biochemistry |
| **Research Focus** | Computational biochemistry & drug discovery for infectious and neurodegenerative diseases |

My research lies at the intersection of biochemistry and computational modeling, with a focus on drug discovery for infectious diseases (malaria, TB, HIV) and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer's. I employ computational techniques including molecular docking, dynamics simulations, and machine learning to study protein-ligand interactions and identify novel therapeutic compounds.

##  Research Projects

### 01  Biocomputational Framework for Identifying Novel Malaria Inhibitors
**Timeline:** 20242025

I independently designed and led this research project to develop **AutoFilter**, an integrated, low-cost computational pipeline for rapidly identifying novel inhibitors of *Plasmodium falciparum*.

**Methodology:**
- Multi-stage framework combining rule-based chemical filtration (Lipinski, Veber, PAINS rules)
- High-throughput molecular docking via AutoDock Vina
- ADME analysis using SwissADME
- ML-based toxicity & synthetic accessibility prediction (eToxPred)
- Molecular dynamics simulations (GROMACS)

**Results:**
- Processed 2.4M compounds from ChEMBL database against P. falciparum apicoplast DNA polymerase
- Identified 5 high-confidence inhibitor candidates with strong binding affinities
- Favorable pharmacokinetics and low predicted toxicity
- One compound achieved **50% inhibition in preliminary in vitro assays**
- Demonstrates AutoFilter as a scalable platform for drug discovery
